# Troubleshooting

## `npx mola-core doctor` says it is not ready

It names what is missing. The usual answers:

**No QEMU with the hvf accelerator.** On a Mac, `brew install qemu`. If you have
a QEMU somewhere else, point at it with `MOLA_QEMU=/path/to/qemu-system-aarch64`.

**No `/dev/kvm`** on Linux. Either virtualisation is off in firmware, or you are
inside a VM whose host does not expose nested virtualisation. Many cloud
instances do not; bare metal always does.

**No python3 or ssh.** Both are used by the automation transport. Install them
through your package manager.

## The engine will not start

**`EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:4141`** means something is
already listening, usually an engine you forgot about. Find it with
`lsof -nP -iTCP:4141 -sTCP:LISTEN` and stop it, or start this one on another port
with `--port=4242`.

**`Runtime did not become healthy`** means the Python supervisor failed to come
up. Its errors are printed with a `[runtime]` prefix above that line. The most
common cause is a Python that cannot import its dependencies; delete
`~/.mola/python` and start again to rebuild the virtualenv.

## A machine never reaches ready

Look at its console log:

```sh
tail -40 ~/.mola/runtime/machines/<id>/console.log
```

**`HVF does not support GICv2 emulation`** means the engine chose the wrong
interrupt controller for your QEMU. Stock QEMU on HVF needs GICv3. Set
`MOLA_GIC=3` and create the machine again.

**`QEMU exited during launch`** is reported with the machine's `runtime.log`
beside the console log. That file holds QEMU's own error.

If the machine stays in `booting` with no errors, the guest daemon is not
reporting in. Check that it can reach the engine: the guest dials `10.0.2.2` on
the engine's port, which QEMU maps back to your loopback interface.

## Screenshots come back garbled

Partial or scrambled frames usually mean the capture is racing the compositor
rather than anything being broken. Send an input event first, such as
`{"action": "key", "key": "super"}`, then capture again.

If every frame is wrong rather than the first one, check that the guest's VNC
server is running:

```sh
curl -s -X POST $API/machines/$ID/actions -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "exec", "command": "pgrep -a wayvnc; ss -ltn | grep 5900"}'
```

## The desktop URL shows "connecting" forever

The ticket works once and expires after sixty seconds. If you reloaded the page,
opened it twice, or waited too long, ask for a new URL.

Changing only the `#fragment` of a URL does not reload a page, so pasting a fresh
ticket over an old one in the address bar will appear to do nothing. Open it in a
new tab, or reload after changing it.

## Creating or waking fails with a limit

The engine refuses to start more machines than it has room for. Defaults are two
running machines and 8192 MB of reserved memory. Raise them with
`MOLA_MAX_RUNNING` and `MOLA_MAX_MEMORY_MB`, or stop a machine you are
not using.

Stopped machines cost disk, not memory, and do not count against either limit.

## Delete returns 502

The engine could not tear the machine down, so it left it registered rather than
forgetting a virtual machine that may still be running. The response says why.
Retry the delete; if it keeps failing, look for the QEMU process yourself and
check `~/.mola/runtime/machines/<id>/` for what is left behind.

## A machine appears that you did not create

On startup the engine adopts anything the runtime is holding that the registry
does not know about, and names it `adopted-<id prefix>`. That means a previous
engine was killed hard enough that it never wrote the record. The machine is
real and running; delete it normally if you do not want it.

## Everything is slow

Check whether graphics are accelerated:

```sh
npx mola-core doctor
```

`software (llvmpipe)` means the guest renders on the CPU. That works, but a
desktop doing a lot of compositing will feel it. A QEMU built with
virglrenderer reports `accelerated (virgl)` instead.

Also worth checking: how many machines are running, and whether the host has
memory left. Each running machine reserves its full `memory_mb`.

## Machines are filling the disk

Each machine's disk grows as it is used, and a guest image is about a gigabyte.
`npx mola-core uninstall` reports what `~/.mola` occupies before removing it, so
it doubles as a way to see where the space went.

To clear the machines but keep the image:

```sh
npx mola-core uninstall --keep-image
```
